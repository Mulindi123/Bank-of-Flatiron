# Bank-of-Flatiron

Project Name: Bank of Flatiron  Author: Medrine Mulindi
Project Description
In this project, I build a React application that displays a list of recent bank transactions. I also create a form where a user fills out their transaction details to add a new transaction. I also implement a search bar for filtering the transactions.
Project set up.

Technologies used 
    • React.js
    • JavaScript
    • Css

Core Deliverables
As a user, I can:
    • See a table of all transactions.
    •  Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new transaction to the table * the new transaction does not have to be persisted to the backend *
    • Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.
