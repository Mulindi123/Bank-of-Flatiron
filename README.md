# Bank-of-Flatiron

Project Name: Bank of Flatiron  Author: Medrine Mulindi
Project Description
In this project, I build a React application that displays a list of recent bank transactions. I also create a form where a user fills out their transaction details to add a new transaction. I also implement a search bar for filtering the transactions.
Project set up.
 Follow these steps to set up this project. 
* Clone this GitHub repository
* The back-end has been deployed at https:/bank-of-flatiron-api.onrender.com/transactions.
*  Run the command 'npm start' on onother terminal to run this application in your browser.

Technologies used 
    * React.js
    * JavaScript
    * Html
    * Css

Core Deliverables
As a user, I can:
   * See a table of all transactions.
   * Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new transaction to the table * the new transaction does not have to be persisted to the backend *
   * Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.

    Bonus Deliverables
    * I have created a POST request to make the form submissions persist to the back end
    * I have implemented a DELETE request to enable the user delete a transaction. This deletion persists to the back end.
